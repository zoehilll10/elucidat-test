# Elucidat Technical Task

## Background

To run this project you will have to have the following installed:
- Python 3.10.9
- behave==1.2.6
- selenium==4.1.0

## To run tests run the behave command in the terminal 



## Other work I could have done
If time allowed there is a lot more I could have done with this project. I had never worked with Gherkin (Cucumber Framework) before so there was an aspect of learning that had to be done. 
If I had more time I would have:
- Automated the other crime case
- Automated the feauture about what researchers say at the end of each case
- Could have automated the real life cases studies at the end of the cases
- I also started to break down the steps file to follow the page object modelling process but did not have time to fully implement. This is something I would have loved to implement as it would make my code more readable and would also reduce duplicate code. 

## Manual testing
I found some manual testing issues along the way too. 
For example:
- "Your score" when choosing a case study to judge states the date not a score. This is confusing to the end user.
- The continue button on the "you decide" page has dark writing not white. This may be difficult for those user who have poor eyesight or glasses wearers.
